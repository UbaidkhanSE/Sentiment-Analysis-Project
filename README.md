# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, sentiment classification, and model evaluation.

# Key Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: The dataset, which contains Twitter data with columns including Tweet ID, Entity, Sentiment, and Tweet Text, is loaded and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistical analysis is performed to understand the distribution of sentiments and visualize sentiment patterns. Sentiment distribution plots and entity-wise sentiment distribution plots are generated to provide insights into public opinion.

Text Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques, including lowercasing, removal of special characters, and stopwords, are applied to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis. This ensures that the text data is in a suitable format for feature extraction.

Feature Extraction: Text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a technique that assigns weights to words based on their importance in the dataset. This allows for the extraction of meaningful features from the text data.

Sentiment Classification: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the extracted features to classify the sentiment of the text data. The model learns to predict whether a given text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on the features extracted from it.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the sentiment classification model is evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance in classifying sentiments.
